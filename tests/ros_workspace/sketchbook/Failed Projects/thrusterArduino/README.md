# thrusterArduino

This is a R7D test for the core firmware and logic for the bottomside arduino microntroller. This firmware is equiped with a rosserial and thruster control software. 

### Goal

A reliable independant microcontroller to provide additional safety features over a direct I2C to PWM converter or onboard PWM signal on the main bottomside computer. 

### Requirments and Description

* Flawless error handling
* Clean commented code
* logical layout and good code practices 
* Good rosserial integration 

### Break down into end to end tests

* 1 hour of rigorous testing on two distinct arduinos with a mix a valid and invlaid messages
* Must be able to handle system crashes and worst case scenario events while providing good debug inforamtion

### Coding detials 

* C++, Arduino
* No classes
